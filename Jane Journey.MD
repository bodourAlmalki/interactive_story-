Going into her grandmother for a visit, Jane  had a decision to make, either to continue her path as planned or to go into an exiting journey in the nearby forest that her parents warned her many times to not go into.

Forest path: 
After a long walk inside the forest, Jana finds herself lost and will get into different situations such as
Smelling flowers
Having hypersensitivity
Approaching a river
Walking into bear 
Walking into a bee hive
Meeting the rabbit
These situations will provoke multiple consequences and decisions which the player will chose between and with every choice Jana’s life is heavily affected.


house path:

This time, jana decides to skip on going into the forest and continue her pathway as planned to her grandmother house, who welcomes her heavily and immediately invite her to a breakfast meal, after that jana was distracted by a ladybug inside the room, She kept following it, meanwhile a cat jumped into the opposite window. The can looked hungry and jana wanted to help her. She tried to open the window a bit; however the can immediately swept through the windows opening into the house, to the ground floor and hide between a group of books. After that another series of consequences will affect janes and her grand mother's life.
